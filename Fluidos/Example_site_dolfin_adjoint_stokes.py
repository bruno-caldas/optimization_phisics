#
# Problem definition
# ******************
#
# This problem is to minimise the dissipated power in the fluid
#
# .. math::
#       \frac{1}{2} \int_{\Omega} \alpha(\rho) u \cdot u + \frac{\mu}{2} \int_{\Omega} \nabla u : \nabla u - \int_{\Omega} f u
#
# subject to the Stokes equations with velocity Dirichlet conditions
#
# .. math::
#       \alpha(\rho) u - \mu \nabla^2 u + \nabla p &= f \qquad \mathrm{in} \ \Omega        \\
#                                  \mathrm{div}(u) &= 0 \qquad \mathrm{on} \ \Omega        \\
#                                                u &= b \qquad \mathrm{on} \ \delta \Omega \\
#
# and to the control constraints on available fluid volume
#
# .. math::
#          0 \le \rho(x) &\le 1  \qquad \forall x \in \Omega \\
#          \int_{\Omega} \rho &\le V
#
# where :math:`u` is the velocity, :math:`p` is the pressure,
# :math:`\rho` is the control (:math:`\rho(x) = 1` means fluid present,
# :math:`\rho(x) = 0` means no fluid present), :math:`f` is a prescribed
# source term (here 0), :math:`V` is the volume bound on the control,
# :math:`\alpha(\rho)` models the inverse permeability as a function of
# the control
#
# .. math::
#       \alpha(\rho) = \bar{\alpha} + (\underline{\alpha} - \bar{\alpha}) \rho \frac{1 + q}{\rho + q}
#
# with :math:`\bar{\alpha}`, :math:`\underline{\alpha}` and :math:`q`
# prescribed constants. The parameter :math:`q` penalises deviations
# from the values 0 or 1; the higher q, the closer the solution will be
# to having the two discrete values 0 or 1.
#
# The problem domain :math:`\Omega` is parameterised by the aspect ratio
# :math:`\delta` (the domain is 1 unit high and :math:`\delta` units
# wide); in this example, we will solve the harder problem of
# :math:`\delta = 1.5`.  The boundary conditions are specified in figure
# 10 of Borrvall and Petersson, reproduced here.

#
# Physically, this problem corresponds to finding the fluid-solid
# distribution :math:`\rho(x)` that minimises the dissipated power in
# the fluid.
#
# As Borrvall and Petersson comment, it is necessary to solve this
# problem with :math:`q=0.1` to ensure that the result approaches a
# discrete-valued solution, but solving this problem directly with this
# value of :math:`q` leads to a local minimum configuration of two
# straight pipes across the domain (like the top half of figure 11).
# Therefore, we follow their suggestion to first solve the optimisation
# problem with a smaller penalty parameter of :math:`q=0.01`; this
# optimisation problem does not yield bang-bang solutions but is easier
# to solve, and gives an initial guess from which the :math:`q=0.1` case
# converges to the better minimum.
#
# Implementation
# **************
#
# First, the :py:mod:`dolfin` and :py:mod:`dolfin_adjoint` modules are
# imported:

from dolfin import *
from dolfin_adjoint import *

# Next we import the Python interface to IPOPT. If IPOPT is
# unavailable on your system, we strongly :doc:`suggest you install it
# <../../download/index>`; IPOPT is a well-established open-source
# optimisation algorithm.

try:
    import pyipopt
except ImportError:
    print("""This example depends on IPOPT and pyipopt. \
  When compiling IPOPT, make sure to link against HSL, as it \
  is a necessity for practical problems.""")
    raise

# turn off redundant output in parallel
parameters["std_out_all_processes"] = False
pasta = "example_stokes_mod2/"
# Next we define some constants, and define the inverse permeability as
# a function of :math:`\rho`.

mu = Constant(1.0)                   # viscosity
alphaunderbar = 2.5 * mu / (100**2)  # parameter for \alpha
alphabar = 2.5 * mu / (0.01**2)      # parameter for \alpha
q = Constant(0.01) # q value that controls difficulty/discrete-valuedness of solution

def alpha(rho):
    """Inverse permeability as a function of rho, equation (40)"""
    return alphabar + (alphaunderbar - alphabar) * rho * (1 + q) / (rho + q)

# Next we define the mesh (a rectangle 1 high and :math:`\delta` wide)
# and the function spaces to be used for the control :math:`\rho`, the
# velocity :math:`u` and the pressure :math:`p`. Here we will use the
# Taylor-Hood finite element to discretise the Stokes equations
# :cite:`taylor1973`.

# Next we define a function that given a control :math:`\rho` solves the
